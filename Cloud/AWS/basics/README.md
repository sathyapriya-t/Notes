# AWS cloud practitioner certification

Cloud computing

→ is an on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage , application and other IT resources.

→ pay-as-you-go pricing

**Deployment model:**

| Private Cloud | Public Cloud | Hybrid Cloud |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to public. | Cloud resources owned and operated by a third party company and delivered over the internet | Some could services are kept private (on premise)and some are extended to the cloud  |
| Have complete control | 7 Advantages | Control over sensitive info in your private infrastructure |
| security for sensitive applications | Eg: Azure, Microsoft and AWS | Flexibility and Cost efficiency of a public cloud. |
| For specific business needs |  |  |

**Advantages of cloud Computing:**

1. **Flexibility:** change resource type when required
2. **Cost-effectiveness**: pay as you go(pay only for what you use)
3. **Scalability:** accommodate large number of loads by hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
4. **Elasticity:** able to scale up and scale in when needed
5. **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**: build across data centre
6. **Agility**: Rapidly develop, test and launch software application

**Types of Cloud Computing:**

**Pricing of Cloud:**

AWS has three fundamental pricing model as pay-as-you-go:

*1. Compute:* pay for the computing time

*2. Storage:* pay for data stored in cloud

*3. Data* transfer *out of cloud*: data transfer IN is free.

**AWS Region:**

- region is cluster of data centers
- names can be us-east-1, us-east-2
- aws region is all around the world.

How to choose region:

→ compliance with data governance

→ Proximity to customers (If it is in distance it will add latency)

→ Pricing varies region to region.

**AWS Availability zones:**

→ each region has three or more availability zone (usually 3 , min 3 and max 6).

→ each availability zone is one or more discrete data centres with redundant power, networking and datacentres.

**AWS Point of presence (Edge location):**

→400+ edge location in 90+ cities.

**Shared responsibility model:**
